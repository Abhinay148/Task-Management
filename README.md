I have made a task management application in which first there is home page where welcoming you & asking to login or signup.
For storing the data I have used the Mongodb localstorage.
For frontend i have used React,Html,CSS,Js.
For Backend server :- Node.js, Express.js
There is 2 pages after the successful login either admin or user.
The admin is set by me on the mongodb storage manually.
After that the user can make a new task or view thier previous task if completed mark the status.
User can also update or delete the tasks.
For Admin have the list of all the users & watch their tasks update it delete it & also assign them tasks.
